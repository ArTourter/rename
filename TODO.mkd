Possible extensions:

* Provide globals with parts of the filename

	* Split path on slashes, put into `@dir`
	* Split filename on first or last dot (but not at start of filename),
	  put basename in `$base`, suffix in `$ext`

* Keep track of directory renames

  So that it can ensure that when you've renamed a directory,
  subsequent renames of stuff under that directory don't fail.
